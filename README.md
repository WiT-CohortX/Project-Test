# Purposes 01
## Practice 
- To Improve our hard and soft skills

## Experience: A Better Resume
- To gain relevant experience and practice the skills/tools in the keywords\* list that can be used on our resume (\*see [Keywords](#keywords))
- To gain material/examples that relates to IT work for job interview questions, such as "Can you tell me about a stressful work situation and how you overcame it?" 

## Presentation/Demonstration:
- To impress the sponsors and showcase our skills to potential employers

## Be prepared: There is a chance that we will fail to deliver a presentable product,
considering:
- This is the **first time** we are working together. 
- We are learning and working **at the same time**. 
- The timeline is **tight**.

# Rules
(Since this is teamwork, I think having some rules would be helpful. Below are what I have thought of so far. They are open to discussion. Feel free to add more if you have any concerns. )

## We don't work for the project, **The Project Works for Us**
- Feel free to suggest any features / functions / tools / methods / rules / libraries / frameworks / platforms / etc that you want to show/practice in the project, as long as:
	- They can be integrated into the project.
	- They won't require significant changes to others' previous contributions.(Some adjustments are OK).
	- They can be completed by the deadline.
- On another hand, ask for help if you meet problems. We can adjust the project or figure out the solution together.
 
## It's a teamwork, so **Be Respectful to Others**
- Our skills / levels vary. Please be patient and supportive of each other's learning and growth.
- Be responsible for your own task. 
- If you need to use others' solutions, make sure to credit the original coder, putting their names and links in the comments as the reference.
- No commercial use is allowed unless otherwise agreed by all contributors. If you want to use other team members' codes in your future work, please ask for the permission.
- Don't exaggerate your contribution(too much😂) because it may harm other team members' job opportunities; if you want to show more, contribute more. 

# Participation

## Small Groups
- If we have enough participants, We'll divide into smaller groups of 2-3 members to work on specific features/tasks.
- Feel free to experiment with different collaboration methods.
- If you have the ability and time, you are welcome to join multiple groups.

## Time for In and Out: The End of Each Stage*
- Ideally, at the end of each stage, we will review our progress, plan for the next stage and regroup. This is the time point to join / leave / rejoin / leave again. 
- You will be credited for your work even if you only participate in part(s) of the work.
- If you want/have to quit, please finish your work of the current stage, even if you no longer need this project.

*See [Timeline](#timeline)

## Business Roles / Multi-Roles are Welcome
- There are other works than development needed: research, writing, UI/UX design, solution design, project management, testing, marketing and etc. 
- If you have the skills, you're welcome to take on multiple roles.

# Project Proposal:

## Two Directions:
### A: Case Study
Study an existing product and enhance it.

Pros:

- "Before/After" comparison can be pretty
- Would look amazing if we can solve some problems

Cons:

- May offend someone who worked on or love the original product
- Heavy study and design work

### B: Features Combination
Combine some common features to a product.

Pros:

- Will be a good practice
- Extendable
- Easy to find solutions/help

Cons:

- Requires design
- Extra work to generate the content

## Mind map
How I shaped the idea:

- Limited time
	- --> Extendable: start with basic functions / features, add more later
	- --> Separable: we can work at the same time; no one should be blocked by others' progress
	- --> Less design, more codes: use mature design system/pattern, plus a little customization
	- --> Common features / functions: they have existing mature solutions; in case we get stuck, references and help can be easily found so we can finish the work in time
- Purpose1: Practice 
	- --> Common features/functions: 
		- Be ready for real work;
		- The best way to learn and gain confidence is to try to solve by yourself and compare your solution with the mature one
- Purpose2: Experience --> less design, more codes: Spend more time on development
- Purpose3: Presentation
	- --> Extendable: first, let's have something to show
	- --> Impress sponsors --> finical industry related
	- --> Less design, more codes: there should be enough interactions to show our skills 
	- ~~--> Serverless/headless: Able to be hosted on GitHub(or similar services)~~ To be discussed
- The project works for us 
	- --> Extendable: to have space to add more features / functions / details
	- --> Separable: Can be broken into small features / functions / tasks, which allow the ladies with different skills/levels work on the suitable ones and benefit from the teamwork most. 

## Recommend Direction B: Investment Website/App
### Key Features:
- Landing Page: common and newbie-friendly
- Multi-step Sign-up Form[1]: a common feature that product owners (should) highly value, and the solutions are easy to find
- Multi-step Portfolio Questionnaire[2]: highly extendable part, can be easy and look good; or can have a lot of interaction and make things fun 
- Choose a Product/Plan: common and newbie-friendly
- Invest Money: extendable
- Monitor the Market(Charts): common; highly extendable: can be a static page just for demo, or pull real data and add more functions

### Optional Features:
- Withdraw money
- Close Account
- Back-end 
- Administration Page
- Smartwatch app (because we have an iOS developer!)
- ...

## Additional Concepts/Flavours:
### Target Audience:
- Female investors; Someone who cares gender equality

### Featured investment product:

- Portfolios(name TBD)that combines companies with the best policies on gender equality and equal rights in the workplace

### Slogan:
- "Invest for a better world!" (this one needs more work😅)

# Tools and Methodology
- To be added after talking with the mentor(s)
- If there is no mentor, then we will study and apply the most popular ones.

# Mentor(s)/Coach(es)
## What we need:
- Evaluate the idea, the plan and the progress at the beginning and the end of each stage
- Provide information/recommendations on tools, methodologies, etc.
- Be job reference(s) for us if they would like

## Time:
- 1-1.5 hours for the initial consultation
- Maybe 0.5-1 hour for a follow-up
- 1 hour/check-point * 3 check-points 
So, in total, 4-5.5hrs
