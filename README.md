## Running Locally

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/WiT-CohortX/Team1-projectX.git

# Enter file
cd Team1-projectX

# Install all packages
npm install

# Start project
npm run dev
```

## Contributing


```bash
# 1. Make sure you have the main update
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a new branch
git checkout -b 'frontend-01'

# 3. Add and commit all changes to your branch
git add
git commit -m "feat: add a new package"

# 4. Push all commits to your branch
git push origin 'frontend-01'
```

After that, go to the main repo on GitHub where you should now see your new branch, create a “Pull Request” for merge your branch with the main branch, and, ask another person in the group to review the code.
